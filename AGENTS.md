# General

These dotfiles target macOS (Apple Silicon), Linux x86, Asahi Fedora (aarch64 ARM).
Share as much as possible across OS while respecting arch diffs.
Makefile defines 5 profiles (micro, minimal, linux, macos, asahi) using symlinks,
brew/dnf installs, services. macOS WM: yabai+skhd or aerospace/flashspace +
sketchybar (lua configs for top/bottom bars in sketchybar/{top,bottom}/).
Asahi: Hyprland (modular lua: asahi/hypr/hyprland.lua + conf.d/*.lua),
quickshell (QML in asahi/quickshell/remix/ for bar/launcher/wallpaper on quicks branch)
+ hyprpaper/hyprlock/hypridle +
ghostty, custom asahi/bin scripts. Shared: nvim (full lua/),
zsh (zim+dots), mpv, ghostty. Always differentiate Linux by arch. Profiles:

- `micro` setup with bash, tmux, and htop where there are almost no rights for the user
- `minimal` setup with nvim, zsh, python, node and more tools installed locally without sudo
- `linux` setup for desktop and server settings with the full suite for both sudo and non-sudo users
- `macos` setup with the full suite of applications, window management and applications for native Apple Silicon
- `asahi` setup with the full suite of applications, window management and applications for Linux ARM

---

We need to always differentiate between the different Linux settings with respect to architecture.

# Executing

- always try to run scripts that do not break the system (have smoketests) and verify that symlinks are present
- always inspect the outputs of scripts and programs yourself to identify bugs and issues
